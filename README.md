# Cyber-Security-Project

Welcome to our Cyber-Security Project. We, Labib Tahmid, Towhidul Islam and Ashraful are trying our best to implement hybrid cipher, a web based project which uses AES encryption and RSA encryption(For now , We will try for decryption also!). This Readme file will be basically our project log, focusing day to day work and also how it works.

Starting our project. Have a outline for the project, lets see how much we can progress!
Forgot many things about web programming, This project is going to be a good way to revise them!

So generating the AES key was simpler but took many time because I overly complicated it. I was trying to convert 16 length letter to 16 length number, with double transposition and etc.
Actually it was easy by taking the key size 8 length letter, because 8 length letter can give 16 length number!

This for today, next day will work on Key expansion!
