# Cyber-Security-Project

Welcome to our Cyber-Security Project. We, Labib Tahmid, Towhidul Islam and Ashraful are trying our best to implement hybrid cipher, a web based project which uses AES encryption and RSA encryption(For now , We will try for decryption also!). This Readme file will be basically our project log, focusing day to day work and also how it works.

Starting my project. Have a outline for the project, lets see how much I can progress!
Forgot many things about web programming, This project is going to be a good way to revise them!

So generating the AES key was simpler but took many time because I overly complicated it. I was trying to convert 16 length letter to 16 length number, with double transposition and etc.
Actually it was easy by taking the key size 8 length letter, because 8 length letter can give 16 length number!

This for today, next day will work on Key expansion!

Worked on Key expansion today, mainly word(0) part. It was tough, rotating and subsitution could be done better, but sticked with the knowledge I have.
Rotating and subsitituion works alright, but i am seeing some "undefined" problem when calling both. Some numbers issue i think, will work on it maybe tomorrow.
After that key expansion will probably finish, very little is left!

3. 06 April 2025 - 07 April 2025

Finally finished Key expansion today! It was hard maintaining all things, small slip up gave
a lot of trouble, such as not padding properly gave undefined error, as each key is dependent on other keys!
Still found all the errors and solved them, hope there is no more errors! Now I will move to main AES Encryption, probably after 2 days, I have some work to do!
All 44 Key looked majestic!
